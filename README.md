[Latest Release](https://travis-ci.org/BlazePowered/Blaze-Server) 

(Warning: builds may be unstable, use at your own risk.)


Currently the major changes from Glowstone include:

* Tracks the [Spigot 1.8.8 update of the Bukkit API](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/)
* New features merged in, adapted for PaperSpigot's update of the Bukkit API (see [features](#features) below for details)
* Multi-API plugin support, integrates with [Bukkit2Sponge](https://github.com/GlowstonePlusPlus/Bukkit2Sponge) for [SpongeAPI](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeAPI) plugin loading
* Builds using Maven

##Building


###1. Setup
After installing [Oracle JDK](http://oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads) or [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/), and
[Maven](https://maven.apache.org), checkout the source:

```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/BlazePowered/Blaze-Server
cd Blaze-Server
```

###2. Build

```sh
./setup.sh
```

The final jar will be placed in `target/` named `blaze-1.8.8-SNAPSHOT.jar`.

##Running

Running Blaze is simple because its dependencies are shaded into the output
jar at compile time. Simply execute `java -jar blaze-{Version}.jar` along with any
extra JVM options desired. A variety of command-line options are also available -
run `java -jar blaze-{Version}.jar --help` for more information.

By default, configuration is stored in the `config/` subdirectory and logs
are stored in the `logs/` subdirectory. The main configuration file is
`config/glowstone.yml`, which replaces CraftBukkit's `server.properties` and
`bukkit.yml`. Settings from these two files will be copied over to Blaze's
configuration during the default configuration generation process.

Blaze uses [JLine](http://jline.sf.net) for console input and colored
console output. The JLine console can be disabled in the configuration if a
flat console is desired.

##Introduction

Blaze is a lightweight, from scratch, open source
[Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) server written in Java that supports plugins
written for the [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org) (and Bukkit) API. It also enhances many of the features of Blaze.

The main goals of the project are to provide a lightweight implementation
of the Spigot API and Minecraft server where exact vanilla functionality is
not needed or higher performance is desired than the official software can
deliver. Blaze makes use of a thread-per-world model and performs
synchronization only when necessitated by the Spigot API.

##Features

Blaze has a few key advantages over CraftBukkit:
 * It is **100% open source**. While CraftBukkit and most other mods are open
   source, they rely on decompiled Minecraft source code. Blaze's code is
   completely original.
 * Because of this, it is easy to contribute to Blaze's development. The
   barrier of entry to contributions is lower because there is no need to work
   around decompiled source or maintain a minimal diff.
 * Blaze supports all plugins written for the Bukkit and Spigot API natively. In
   practice, some plugins may try to make use of parts of the API which are not
   yet implemented, but in a completed state Blaze would support all Bukkit plugins.
 * Blaze's simplicity affords it a performance improvement over CraftBukkit
   and other servers, making it especially suited for situations where a large
   amount of players must be supported but vanilla game features are not needed.
 
However, there are several drawbacks:
 * Blaze **is not finished**. Nothing is guaranteed to work, though many things
   are likely to. If in doubt, file an issue.
 * Bukkit plugins which expect the presence of CraftBukkit-specific code
   (that in the `org.bukkit.craftbukkit` or `net.minecraft.server` packages)
   will not work on Blaze unless they are designed to fail gracefully.
 * Blaze is not produced by the Bukkit team, and while we do make an effort
   to produce quality work, Blaze does not undergo the same rigorious testing
   as the Bukkit project.

##Docs and Support

The best place to receive support is on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/GlowstonePlusPlus/GlowstonePlusPlus/issues).
When reporting bugs, please retest and include whether the problem reproduces on:

* Earlier [builds](https://circleci.com/gh/GlowstonePlusPlus/GlowstonePlusPlus) of Blaze
* [Glowstone](https://github.com/GlowstoneMC/Glowstone), if applicable

Javadocs can be generated by using the `mvn javadoc:javadoc` command and are
placed in the `target/site/apidocs/` directory, but these are incomplete
-in some places and in general the code is the best reference.

For documentation on the Glowkit API (an updated Bukkit which is used to
write plugins), see the Glowkit Javadocs
or visit Spigot's [Bukkit Javadocs](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/).
